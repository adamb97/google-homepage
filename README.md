# Google Homepage
This is my first attempt at creating or recreating a web page with HTML/CSS. I will be showcasing skills I have learned such as flow, the display property, and others. I will update this and reflect upon finishing the project
I tried to use CSS Grid at first, but after some talking with some people on the forum, I think that might be a little bit of overkill for such a simple project, so I'm going to attempt to do this without grid or flexbox; because this project is about the basics, and that's it. What I'm trying to showcase with this project is that I know the basics of HTML and CSS


#Reflection
I found this project to be extremely diffiuclt to start, because I kept trying to utilize more advanced concepts like flexbox and grid, but ended up getting lost in learning those and lost sight of how simple this page can be. So, I decided that I wanted to go back and format this site without the use of Grid or Flexbox. This are concepts that I will have to learn, certainly, but this is my first project so I don't want to overcomplicate things with this.
