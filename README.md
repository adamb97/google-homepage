This is my first attempt at creating or recreating a web page with HTML/CSS. I will be showcasing skills I have learned such as flow, the display property, and others. I will update this and reflect upon finishing the project
I tried to use CSS Grid at first, but after some talking with some people on the forum, I think that might be a little bit of overkill for such a simple project, so I'm going to attempt to do this without grid or flexbox; because this project is about the basics, and that's it. What I'm trying to showcase with this project is that I know the basics of HTML and CSS
